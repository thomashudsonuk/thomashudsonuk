### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Mathematician, graduating in 2022 from the University of Bath, and an Operational Researcher ([Fast Streamer](https://www.faststream.gov.uk/)) in the UK Civil Service.

This is my personal GitHub profile. Some of my activity is on private work profiles, due to sensitivity.

I have worked in:
- [The Department for Work and Pensions](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions) (DWP) as an Operational Researcher
- [Building Digital UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/building-digital-uk) (BDUK) as a Data Analyst
- [The Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology) (DSIT) as a Place-Based Analyst
